A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts.

In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.

# Aim:


This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on factors like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

FACTORS

1. id: unique identifier
2. gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
3. age: age of the patient
4. hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
5. heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
6. ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
7. work_type: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
8. Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
9. avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
10. bmi: body mass index
11. smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*
12. stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not


*Note: "Unknown" in smoking_status means that the information is unavailable for this patient


CONCLUSION:
IN REFERENCE TO MY ANALYSIS , AGE AND THE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL OF A PERSON ARE THE TWO MAJOR PREDICTOR OF A PATIENT STROKE STATUS 
THE OLDER A PERSON GETS , THE HIGHER THEIR CHANCES OF EXPERIENCING STRONG 
THE HIGHER A PERSON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL , THE HIGHER THE CHANCES OF THEM EXPERIENCING STROKE 
ALSO THE AGE AND BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL OF A PERSON HAVE A VERY POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP, THIS SIMPLY MEANS , THE PEROBABILITY OF OLD AGE INFLUENCING A PERSON GLUCOSE LEVEL IS REALLY HIGH
